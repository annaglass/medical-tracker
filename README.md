Data Structures - Medical Tracker Final Project

- This was the final project for data structures, part A compares doubly linked list with hash table with quadratic probing, part B compares bubble sort with heap sort
- Project writeup includes graphs of timing comparing the structures in part A and B, and coming to a conclusion based on this graph
- There was a problem with heap sort because I called heapify from 0, which essentially doesn't sort the data and hence the graph is off
- Learned about timing functions using clock(), time complexity, figuring out which data structures would be more useful in the applicable situation of sorting medical data
